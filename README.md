# Attack-On-Titan-Utopia

This is my submission for the GUC CSEN 401 Course projects which has won the 3rd rank out of 440 other skilled teams.

Attack on Titan: Utopia is a turn-based 2D endless Tower Defense game in which you try to hold Titans from destroying all your lanes and as many waves as possible. it was coded by Java through OOP concepts and brought to life through JavaFX. there are currently 4 weapons and 4 Titans in the game.

Weapons: Piercing Cannon: Attacks the closest 5 Titans in the lane Sniper Cannon: Attacks the closest titan in a lane Volley Spread Cannon: Attacks all titans between distances 20 and 50 from the wall Wall Trap: Attacks 1 Titan touching the Wall

Titans: Pure: no special power Abnormal: attacks the wall twice per turn Armored: takes 25% of the damage received Colossal: speed increments by 1 each turn

To try the game: 1-Download the latest version of JavaFX (preferably on Eclipse IDE) 2-Download the source code as well as the CSV files and import them into Eclipse 3-Run the game and enjoy :)
